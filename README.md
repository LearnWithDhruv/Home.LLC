#  Voice Bot using GROK API (POC)

This project is a proof-of-concept (POC) voice bot built using Grok’s API. It can respond like grok to a predefined set of personal questions (and more), providing human-like responses to voice inputs. It includes a front-end client and a Node.js-based backend server.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatgpt-voice-bot.git
cd chatgpt-voice-bot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create `.env` File

Inside the `server/` folder, create a `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:

```env
Groq_API_KEY=your-grok-api-key
```

##  Run the Server

```bash
node server.js
```

Server runs by default on:  
`http://localhost:5000`

---

## Open the Frontend

Navigate to:  
`http://localhost:5000/public`

You’ll see the voice UI. Hit the record button, speak a question, and the bot will respond with a text message generated by ChatGPT API.

## Sample Questions the Bot Can Answer

The bot is trained to handle conversational prompts like:

- "What should we know about your life story in a few sentences?"
- "What’s your #1 superpower?"
- "What are the top 3 areas you’d like to grow in?"
- "What misconception do your coworkers have about you?"
- "How do you push your boundaries and limits?"

## Notes

- Ensure microphone permissions are enabled in the browser.
- API key must remain private — do not expose your `.env` to the public.
- Built using Node.js, Express, and OpenAI API.
